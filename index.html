  I've gone 5 long minutes without Deepwoken. It pains me to say it, but I'm beginning to think I'm attracted to the game in some way or other, maybe even
sexually... Last night my mother told me to shower and I honestly thought this was unforgivable. With my main slot, Adam Kotof, I used Master's Flourish on
her, doing huge amounts of damage and healing my disabilities with the bloodless gem. She started crying and told me to stop, asking me where her son was. I
told her that I, Adam Kotof, killed her son and that I was the replacement. She scratched my face so I made great use of Shoulder Bash and ran into her at full
force. She was shaken due to my 90 strength and high-level mantras. I swung my Vampirism Shattered Katana twice, doing incredible amounts of damage and
flourishing her into a corner. Summing up all my strength, I made great use of my mantra Rapid Punches and hit her continuously in a wall combo. I followed up
with Strong Left and I had knocked her. Usually in Deepwoken when people are knocked they can still talk, but for some reason she didn't. Then I remembered,
I'm not playing Deepwoken, this is real life. With the will to wipe, I gripped her using my Vampirism Shattered Katana. I saw her go depths and then I spawned
my Frigate and sailed into the Void Sea at which point I jumped into a whirlpool with the intent of going to the depths.
I woke up in the depths and immediately found her, she was sitting, crying against the wall, muttering to herself about what was wrong with me as a child. I
began to wonder if what I was doing was really right when the sudden need for fresh blood rose within me. I equipped my sword and press H on my keyboard to
proc my Murmur Manifestation, Ardour. Next I swung my Vampirism Shattered Katana and pressed C to make use of Shard Bow, knocking her quickly. I ran
over to her and said, "Sorry mum, Deepwoken is more important" before gripping her and sending her into the Fragments of Self, so she would have to be a freshie.
